        <h3>A History</h3>
        <p>Android Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California in October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White.
        Rubin described the Android project as "tremendous potential in developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its
        owner's location and preferences".[</p>
        <p>The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras,
          and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in April 2004.</p>

        <h3>The Acquisition</h3>
        <p>In July 2005, Google acquired Android Inc. for at least $50 million.
          Its key employees, including Rubin, Miner and White, joined Google as part of the acquisition.
          Not much was known about the secretive Android at the time, with the company having provided
          few details other than that it was making software for mobile phones.</p>
        <p>At Google, the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel.</p>
        <p>Google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradeable system.
          Google had "lined up a series of hardware components and software partners and signaled to carriers that
          it was open to various degrees of cooperation".</p>
