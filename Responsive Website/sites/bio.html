        <h1 class="page_title">Early Life</h1>
        <p><span id="italic">Lionel Andrés Messi</span> was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from Marche and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute of his grandmother.</p>
        <h1 class="page_title">Career</h1>
        <p class="dark">Messi progressed through the ranks and was given his first appearance in the 2004/05 season becoming the youngest player to score a league goal.
           In 2006, Messi was part of the double winning team which won both La Liga (Spanish League) and Champions League.
            By next season, (2006-07) aged just 20, Messi was the first choice striker and an essential part of the Barcelona team –
            scoring 14 goals in 26 league games.
            In the 2009-10 season, Messi scored 47 goals in all competitions,
            equalling Ronaldo’s record total for Barcelona. As the seasons have progressed,
            Messi kept improving and breaking his own records. In the calendar year of 2012,
            he broke the all-time world record for most goals scored in a calendar year.
            His final total of goals in 2012 was 91 – beating the previous record of 85 by German Gerd Muller,
            and Pele’s milestone of 75 in 1958.</p>
